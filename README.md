Markaround
==========

Markaround is a plain text formatting syntax for writing for the web.

It is a better Markdown (at least for me) with:
* one and only one way to do something (I'm looking at you Markdown headers, lists and emphasis)
* intuitive emphasis (closer to what's used in plain text email)
* intuitive line breaks (newline = line break)
* syntax for strikethrough (because you always change your mind and/or make mistakes)
* more readable header syntax
* consistent linking syntax
* code block syntax designed for easy copy-pasting in the common case
