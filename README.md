# Markaround

Markaround is a shorthand replacement for the most commonly used subset of HTML for writing on the web.

Writing in Markaround is half way between using a WYSIWYG editor and hand-coding HTML.

The problem with WYSIWYG editors is not so much that you cannot control the HTML it generates as the HTML mess it creates. Markaround's syntax can be unambiguously and unsurprisingly converted to HTML so you always know what HTML will be generated. It's not the same as hand-coding HTML, but it's good enough most of the time.
